			<h1>Spooky Month</h1>
				<p>Spooky Month is a web series made by Sr. Pelo!</p>

			<h1>What are Shimeji?</h1>
				<p>Now, just what are Shimeji?</p>
				<p>These are little desktop pets similar to Ghosts, but they don't interact as much with you. They ARE cute though! And most of their appeal is to just watch them do thir thing!</p>
				<p>There's a ton of them! Most are based on a character from an Anime or some Video Games. And it's rare to NOT find what you want!</p>
				<p>Wanna download the program? Here's a link to the english version: <a href="https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/">Shimeji-ee Website</a></p>
				<p>So, yeah they don't do much, but they have their fans!</p>

				<p>It's criminal that these two don't have a Shimeji! ...At least when I'm writing this, they dont!</p>
