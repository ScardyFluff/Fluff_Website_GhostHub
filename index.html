			<h1>ScardyFluff's Ghost Hub</h1>
				<img src="assets/images/intro1.png" alt="Picture of some balloons." width="auto" height="auto" class="imgcenter" />
				<p>Welcome to this little corner of the internet! I'm ScardyFluff! But you can call me Fluff! I've made this site to share my little creations! Right now, there's only some Balloons for Ukagaka. But soon I'll add some Ghosts!</p>
				<p>Though, take note of some things! I refer to Ukagakas as Ghosts and... Kinda use both terms interchangeably. Though they DO mean the same thing! One is the Japanese name, and the other is the English name! Oh! And... I miiiight take a while to release Ghosts. Some others might release them much more frequently, maybe? But I take my time! Maybe too much time. :P</p>
				<p>But hey! I hope you enjoy what I do!</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<p>This site is VERY WIP- Some buttons might not work yet! So keep your hand on the back button if something freaks!</p>

			<h1>What's an Ukagaka/Ghost?</h1>
				<p>An Ukagaka, or Ghost, is a character that sits on your desktop! They can do stuff for you such as emptying your recycling bin, checking for new emails, checking the weather and more! Most of the time they'll just keep you company and say stuff.<br><br>Ghosts are very diverse though, and some have a strong focus on story and discovering information, while others are full of interesting functions or games.</p>
			<h1>How do I use a ghost?</h1>
				<p>To use a ghost, you'll need a program to run it in. If you're on Windows, you can use <a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/">SSP</a>. If you're not on a Windows PC there are some other options available, but you'll have to play around and see what works for ya.<br><br>Mac: <a href="https://www14.big.or.jp/~ayase/ese/">Ukagaka on Macs</a>, <a href="http://ccm.sherry.jp/ninni/index.en.html">NiseRingo</a>, <a href="http://tablesalt.o0o0.jp/ukagaka/ct_maconssp.html">PlayonMac+SSP</a>, <a href="https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/">WineBottler</a><br>Linux: <a href="http://ninix-aya.osdn.jp/">NINIX-AYA</a></p>
				<p>For those using SSP, go ahead and download the complete install package from the website. To the left and the top one! When you run it, a catgirl named Emily should appear and greet you in Japanese. Drag and drop the .nar file you downloaded onto her, and she should install them for you. Once she's done, right click her, hover over 'Change Ghost', and select your brand new ghost!</p>
				<p>If you get an error message or window in Japanese when you start SSP, it probably can't find any ghosts to run. You can try dropping the .nar file onto that window. If that doesn't work, click the first button and point it towards your ghost directory(It should be \SSP\ghost).<br><br>If the right click menu is in Japanese, the language option is the 4th one up from the bottom. Select English, and restart SSP (you can close it with the lowest option), and you should be good to go!<br><br>If the catgirl will not install any ghosts for you, you can unzip the .nar file and drag the contents into the \SSP\ghost folder. Your unzipped folder should have subfolders called 'ghost' and 'shell' on the top level. Restart SSP and look in the right click menu again, and they should be in your list of ghosts.<br><br>Instructions on how to use each ghost are in their readme, which should automatically pop up when you install them! If it doesn't appear, you can see it by opening them, right clicking, and going to Information>Read me.</p>

				<p>What else...</p>
				<p>OH! I collect Fanfics? I download them, and fix up the file so it takes less space? And so it looks 100 times better? Heh. You probably didn't care too much about that. :p</p>
				<p>I should mention this too, just in case I seem rude, I'm VERY likely not being rude on purpose!</p>
				<p>Also, I SHOULD'VE placed this info on the top, but meh.</p>
				<p>I'm Autistic, and also like to refer to myself as They/Them or She/Her! Also-Also, I'm from Latin America. So OF COURSE I know Spanish! Feel free to talk to me in Spanish or English! (Tho I prefer English but hey! Use any language that you'd like! I can Google Translate too! heeeh.)</p>

<!-- Interested in joining our Ukagaka webring? All you need to do is uncomment the chunk of code below, and submit your finished website here! https://ukagakawebring.netlify.app/ If you're not sure what a webring is, it's basically a service that lets all the websites in the webring link to each other dynamically! It's a cool (if extremely outdated) way to find new content. If you click on that ukagakawebring link you can see all the sites already connected and explore a bit! I will note, if you're on a chrome-based browser, all of the links seem to act as a random button.-->
