        <!--You shouldn't need to change anything here, unless you want to change the wording. You can feel free to get rid of or change this section as you like, of course, but it's really just the basic rundown on ghosts-->
        <h1>What's an Ukagaka/ghost?</h1>
        <p>An Ukagaka, or ghost, is a character that sits on your desktop! They can do little tasks for you such as emptying your recycling bin, checking for new emails, or checking the weather. Mostly they'll just keep you company and say random dialogue.<br><br>Ghosts are very diverse, some have a strong focus on story and discovering information, while others are full of interesting functions or games.</p>
        <h1>How do I use a ghost?</h1>
        <p>To use a ghost, you'll need a program to run it in. If you're on Windows, you can use <a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/">SSP</a>. If you're not on a Windows computer there are some options available, but you'll have to play around and see what works for you.<br><br>Mac: <a href="https://www14.big.or.jp/~ayase/ese/">Ukagaka on Macs</a>, <a href="http://ccm.sherry.jp/ninni/index.en.html">NiseRingo</a>, <a href="http://tablesalt.o0o0.jp/ukagaka/ct_maconssp.html">PlayonMac+SSP</a>, <a href="https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/">WineBottler</a><br>Linux: <a href="http://ninix-aya.osdn.jp/">NINIX-AYA</a></p>
        <p>For those using SSP, go ahead and download the complete install package from the website. When you run it a catgirl should appear and say something in Japanese. Drag and drop the .nar file you download for this ghost on her, and she should install them for you. Once she's done, right click her, hover over 'change ghost', and select the appropriate ghost!</p>
        <p>If you get an error window in Japanese when you start SSP, it probably can't find any ghosts to run. You can try dropping the .nar file onto that window. If that doesn't work, click the first button and point it towards your ghost directory(It should be \SSP\ghost).<br><br>If the right click menu is in Japanese, the language option is the 4th one up from the bottom. Select English, restart SSP(you can close it with the bottom option), and you should be good to go.<br><br>If the catgirl will not install any ghosts for you, you can unzip the .nar file and drag the contents into the \SSP\ghost folder. Your unzipped folder should have subfolders called 'ghost' and 'shell' on the top level. Restart SSP and look in the right click menu again, and they should be in your list of ghosts.<br><br>Instructions on how to use each ghost are in their readmes, which should automatically pop up when you install them! If it doesn't appear, you can see it by opening them, right clicking, and going to information>Read me.</p>
		<!--TODO: Interested in joining our Ukagaka webring? All you need to do is uncomment the chunk of code below, and submit your finished website here! https://ukagakawebring.netlify.app/ If you're not sure what a webring is, it's basically a service that lets all the websites in the webring link to each other dynamically! It's a cool (if extremely outdated) way to find new content. If you click on that ukagakawebring link you can see all the sites already connected and explore a bit! I will note, if you're on a chrome-based browser, all of the links seem to act as a random button.-->
